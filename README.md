## Elevator pitch ‚è±Ô∏è

Ditto is a mashup of my favourite features from other languages.

It's functional, statically typed, and pure. But unlike many other languages in this category, it also aims to be ruthlessly simple - the syntax is small and the type system is low power.

It has no runtime of its own. There are far more mature compilers and ecosystems out there that I want to make use of, and would be naive to try and replace. So ditto can be thought of, instead, as an _alternative syntax_ for other tools.

Ditto is not just a compiler, it's _the_ language swiss army knife. Package management, linting, formatting, etc, are all handled by the `ditto` executable. Although this violates the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) it is my hope that it makes for a better developer experience. Because developer experience matters.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

Ditto is still pre-v0.1 and very unstable. It is only for the curious at this stage.

## Design notes

- "There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it." - [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)
- "Small is beautiful" - [Lua design](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100310-slides.pdf)
- "Clear is better than clever" - [Go Proverb](https://go-proverbs.github.io/)
  - Alternatively, "Verbose is better than terse" - Me
  - Optimise for reading and understanding, not for writing.
- Best practice over backwards compatibility üî•
- Anti-magic. Anti-fancy.
- Safe by default, but _explicit_ escape hatches when you need them.
- Embrace code generation.
