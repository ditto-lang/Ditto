# The ditto Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)

This crate is mainly concerned with parsing the ditto syntax.

The node types capture as much syntactic information as possible to facilitate lossless formatting by [`ditto-fmt`](../ditto-fmt).

You can read more about the difference between _concrete_ syntax trees and _abstract_ syntax trees [here][parse tree wiki].
